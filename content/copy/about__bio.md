Welcome!

I'm Ye Cheng. My legal name consists of a two-word first name and a two-word last name that no one can pronounce. I'm convinced my parents went a little too far thinking how special I am when they named me. Ever since grade school, everyone I met gave up and called me by my last name, Ye, instead. Kanye has no right to take that away from me!

After decades of lurking in the shadows, I decided to start writing. My first post explains why I think writing is key to survival in the future. My goal is to write a post a week. I'd be elated if I can build up the habit to write consistently.

The topics that interest me are software and management. I'm also an amateur investor who have suffered plenty of battle wounds, a serial failure in starting shit that nobody wants, and a whisky illiterate (though not because of my failures). Despite all these failures, I consider myself quite lucky to be where I am.

I hope you are able to get some value from my posts. What I love most is an opportunity to learn from you. If you have feedback, connect with me on Twitter [@cyyapye](https://twitter.com/cyyapye) or if you have more to say, email me at cyyapye (at) gmail.
