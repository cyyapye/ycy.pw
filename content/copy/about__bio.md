Welcome!

I'm just starting to write after decades of lurking in the shadows. My first post explains why I think writing is key to survival in the future. My goal is to write a post a week. I'd be elated if I can build up the habit to write consistently.

I hope you find my posts helpful. What I love most is an opportunity to learn from you. If you have feedback, connect with me on Twitter [@cyyapye](https://twitter.com/cyyapye) or if you have more to say, email me at cyyapye (at) gmail.
